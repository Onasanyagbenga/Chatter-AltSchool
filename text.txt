I want to become an MLH Fellow because I believe this  opportunity will propel my growth as a software engineer in ways a traditional internship cannot. The chance to contribute to impactful open-source projects excites me, as it allows me to directly engage with technologies and communities that power countless applications worldwide. I have always been drawn to the collaborative nature of open-source development. Working on diverse projects, tackling real-world challenges, and collaborating with talented engineers from around the world will not only broaden my technical skills but also enhance my problem solving abilities and adaptability. This experience will definatly shape me into a more proficient and well-rounded software engineer, ready to tackle future challenges with confidence and creativity.
